      "description": "<p>In an era of political polarization, disinformation and institutional distrust, journalism\u2019s traditional emphasis on dysfunction often leaves audiences feeling overwhelmed, disillusioned and disengaged. But what if our reporting could restore agency, inspire civic participation and rebuild trust?</p>\n<br>\n<p>This hands-on workshop introduces solutions journalism \u2014 a rigorous, evidence-based framework for reporting not just on problems, but on how people and institutions are responding. Participants will explore how solutions-focused stories can deepen public understanding of democracy, elevate underreported voices and help audiences imagine a more just and functional future.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll unpack the limits of the conventional \u201cwatchdog\u201d model of journalism and explore how shifting toward response-driven reporting \u2014 especially in coverage of civic life, elections, local government and social movements \u2014 can more effectively serve our communities. This approach is especially vital for Asian American journalists and other journalists of color, whose communities are often stereotyped, ignored or flattened in mainstream narratives.</p>\n<p>Through real-world case studies, peer examples and exercises, participants will learn how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and pitch democracy-related solutions stories;</li>\n<li>Report \u201chowdunits\u201d that reveal not just what\u2019s broken, but also how people are solving these problems;</li>\n<li>Avoid audience burnout while increasing impact;</li>\n<li>Use solutions reporting to foster trust, bridge divides and amplify civic agency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re covering government accountability, grassroots organizing or efforts to heal fractured communities, this session offers concrete tools to evolve your craft \u2014 and contribute to a journalism legacy that informs, empowers and uplifts.</p>",

While the corrupting influence of big money on politics isn\u2019t new, today\u2019s threats are distinct, with fewer limits than ever before on what megadonors can do to enrich their companies and themselves at the expense of everyday Americans. Join us for a discussion on how journalism is covering the new American oligarchy so far. Campaign finance reporters will join Brennan Center experts to talk about the stories emerging from this unique moment. Is the press succeeding in bringing them to the public? Are journalists missing anything? The panel will offer best practices for working with donor data, campaign finance regulations and other information necessary to draw a picture of what\u2019s happening and who benefits. They will explore how the new oligarchy\u2019s power is showing up in so many spheres of American life, its implications for communities of color and how journalists can meet the moment.</p>",

      "description": "<p>We\u2019re in a moment where the competition for eyeballs and attention is fierce. Newsrooms are navigating challenges on social and search, and staff and budgets are being slashed. With so much content and the emergence of AI, it can sometimes be hard to discern what\u2019s real or fake. But strong reporting is what makes you rise above the rest. Strong reporting teaches someone something new. It takes them behind the scenes of a story. It provides analysis of the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the \u201cwhat.\u201d It is compelling, interesting \u2014 and maybe even fun. Strong reporting helps you win the day on your beat whenever you publish a story. It gets your story to lead the daily ticker. It\u2019s being the authoritative voice on news that matters to your readers and viewers. At The Athletic, it\u2019s avoiding what our editors have coined the \u201cmessy middle.\u201d The messy middle is dutiful, not impactful, coverage. During this 90-minute session, we will explain how The Athletic approaches reporting through the perspective of reporters, editors and producers, as well as those who amplify their work: social media editors and programmers. We also will split off into small groups for participants to ask questions and share work with the panelists.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Intended takeaways from this workshop:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creativity + ideation with your editor</li>\n<li>How to win on your beat every day</li>\n<li>Relationship/source development</li>\n<li>Being a pro on the beat + holding yourself to a higher standard</li>\n<li>Ways to bolster your storytelling</li>\n<li>Cross-promoting + amplifying your work</li>\n<li>AANHPI coverage: data + trends</li>\n</ul>",

Still, beyond these high-profile tragedies, firearm-related deaths \u2014 especially suicides \u2014 are rising in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Accurately reporting on this crisis requires data, but journalists and advocates often face gaps and limitations in what information is available. This hands-on workshop will guide attendees through the complex landscape of gun violence mortality data. Participants will get an overview of key data sources and a tutorial on using CDC WONDER (Wide-Ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research), a federal mortality database. We\u2019ll explore both the strengths and shortcomings of this tool \u2014 particularly its limited disaggregated AAPI data \u2014 and discuss strategies to bridge these gaps in storytelling and advocacy.</p>",
